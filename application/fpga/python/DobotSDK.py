open-dobot SDK.

SDK providing high-level functions to control Dobot via the driver to open firmware, which, in turn, controls Dobot FPGA.
Abstracts specifics of commands sent to FPGA.

It is assumed that upon SDK initialization the arms are beetween 0 and 90 degrees - beetween their normal
horizontal and vertical positions.
Upon initialization accelerometers are read to figure out current arms' configuration. Accelerometers get confused
when rear arm leans backwards from the dobot base or when forearm bends towards the base.
Also, Inverse Kinematics at the moment don't account for when forearm is looking up (higher than it's
normal horizontal position). So be gentle and give dobot some feasible initial configuration in case it happened
to be beyond the mentioned limits.
Refer to docs/images/ to find more about reference frame, arm names and more.

SDK keeps track of the current end effector pose, thus in case the arm slips or motors are disabled while
in move (with the "Laser Adjustment" button) it has to be re-initialized and SDK re-initialized.
